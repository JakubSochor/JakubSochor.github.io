<p align="justify">
I am originally from the Czech Republic where I studied at Brno University of Technology. 
When I finished my Ph.D. from Machine Learning and Computer Vision, I moved to Zurich, Switzerland where I worked at PTC and Google on various projects using Machine Learning.

In my free time, I like to go on a hike â€“ especially to the Swiss mountains. Furthermore, I&nbsp;enjoy playing badminton, ultimate frisbee, or some board games.
