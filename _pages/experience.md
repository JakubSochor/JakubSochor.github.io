### Google
#### Software Engineer -- level 4 <span class="time-span">(08/2019 - present, Zurich)</span>
 - I was a member of Proactive Google Assistant.
 - During the time at Google, I **owned and lead** various projects that usually applied Machine Learning methods.
    - Machine Learning project focused on optimization of proactive notifications
    - Prediction of users' actions using Machine Learning methods
    - Increasing Assistant usage based on predicted users' actions

### PTC
#### Senior Deep Learning Engineer <span class="time-span">(08/2018 - 07/2019, Zurich)</span>
   - I was a key team member working on a project that used Machine Learning methods for Augmented Reality. 
   - The goal of the project was to estimate 6 DoF pose of objects without any real training images using only 3D models of the objects.
   - See a [demo](https://youtu.be/GU7x_cQ7m2w) of the project and a [reference letter]({{ '/assets/references/2019-PTC.pdf' | relative_url }}).  

### Vlatacom
