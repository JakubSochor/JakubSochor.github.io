My name is Jakub Sochor (Ing. Ph.D.) and this is my professional personal presentation. I am originally from Czech Republic where I studied at Brno University of Technology. 
After I finished my Ph.D. from Machine Learning and Computer Vision, I moved to Zurich, Switzerland where I worked at PTC and Google on various projects using Machine Learning.
In my free time, I like to go on a hike (especially in Switzerland), play badminton, ultimate frisbee or some board games.
