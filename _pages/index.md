<p align="justify">
I am originally from the Czech Republic where I studied at the Brno University of Technology. 
When I finished my Ph.D. from Machine Learning and Computer Vision, I moved to Zurich, Switzerland where I worked at PTC and Google on various projects using Machine Learning. After some time in Zurich, I and my wife decided to move back to the Czech Republic to start a family.

I have experience with many aspects of software engineering and ML research
 - **Top level research** - supported by my first-author publications in top level conferences and journals (e.g. CVPR, CVIU) during my Ph.D. studies
 - **Applied research** - as shown by novel and innovative solutions developed in all the companies I have worked at in the past
 - **Large scale infrastructure** - the features I have launched at Google were actively used by hundreds of thousands users daily and at the same time, the service had to handle thousands of requests per second
 - **Project leadership** - I led projects that were successfully launched at Google and Innovatrics 
 - **People management** - I managed a team of 7 at Innovatrics
 - **Architecture and SW design** - I designed multiple services and libraries during my professional experience
