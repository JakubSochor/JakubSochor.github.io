### Google
#### Software Engineer -- level 4 <span class="time-span">(08/2019 - present, Zurich)</span>
 - I was a member of Proactive Google Assistant
 - I **owned and led** various projects that applied Machine Learning methods
 - Other, more junior, team members have worked on the projects that I have led; therefore, I was responsible also for the coordination of the project work and communicating the status to stakeholders
 - The features I have launched are used by hundreds of thousands of users daily


### PTC
#### Senior Deep Learning Engineer <span class="time-span">(08/2018 - 07/2019, Zurich)</span>
   - I was a key team member working on a project that used Machine Learning methods for Augmented Reality
   - The goal of the project was to estimate 6 DoF pose of objects without any real training images using only 3D models of the objects
   - I was responsible for the initial design, implementation, and experimentation, while the other team members started contributing to the project afterwards
   - The project was commercially launched as a part of the Vuforia Engine for Augmented Reality
   - See a [demo](https://youtu.be/GU7x_cQ7m2w) of the project and a [reference letter]({{ '/assets/references/2019-PTC.pdf' | relative_url }})

### Vlatacom
#### Computer Vision Developer <span class="time-span">(11/2017 – 01/2018, Belgrade)</span>
   - I spent three months on a secondment in Vlatacom within iARTIST European project
   - The outcome of the secondment was a proof of concept for the application of fine-grained vehicle classification and vehicle colour recognition

### Brno University of Technology
#### Researcher – Computer Vision & Machine Learning <span class="time-span">(11/2013 – 07/2018, Brno)</span> 
   - I worked on research in automatic traffic surveillance, specifically vehicle re-identification, automatic camera calibration, fine-grained recognition of vehicles
   - The [results]({% link _pages/publications.md %}) of the research were published in top Computer Vision and Machine Learning journals and conferences (CVPR, CVIU, etc.)  
   - The contributions to the State of the Art included improved design of Convolution Neural Networks, automatic camera calibration methods, and other

### Honeywell
#### Software Engineering Intern <span class="time-span">(06/2013 – 08/2013, Brno)</span>
   - I worked on a project that was focused on testing aircraft hardware and software using Computer Vision methods
